README for Subdownloader

    Running

        Whether you want to run in CLI (Command Line Interface) or 
        GUI (Graphical User Interface), the only file you'll need to call is run.py.

        Common example: python run.py --help
        
        
    Problems on first time run

        Is it complaining about 'subdownloader' existance?

        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "run.py", line 40, in <module>
            import gui.main
          File "/path/to/subdownloader-read-only/gui/__init__.py", line 20, in <module>
            from subdownloader import APP_TITLE, APP_VERSION, OSDBServer, subtitlefile, videofile
        ImportError: No module named subdownloader

        You might have to change subdownloader root directory name. 
        If you executed "svn checkout http://subdownloader.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ subdownloader-read-only", do the following:

            * Unix: mv /path/to/subdownloader-read-only /path/to/subdownloader/subdownloader 
            
    Can a read this with some coloring and text format, like a wiki?
